Color Mixin Creator

I'm on the first baby steps for this App.

The idea came while working with less files and adding darken() and lighten() functions to a color. 

I couldn't see the actual color that was created after apply that functions -the way was to open a file on the browser, 
check developer tools and see the CSS property for that color.

So I decided to build this very simple tool to see the color created when applied this functions to it.

Hope this could be helpful to anyone!
